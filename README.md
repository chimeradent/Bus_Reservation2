Now we are in the very early stages, so it is difficult to put a specific time on the training, but we will keep people informed as plans are developed. The system is very user friendly, and it is anticipated that functions of the system will be easily accessed by administrators, academics, students and applicants. Hence the reservation system for the Bus reservation has been designed to remove all the deficiency from which the present system is suffering and to ensure. 
PROBLEM DEFINITION:- 
This system is based on a concept to reserve bus tickets. From this system, the user can view bus list, book tickets, cancel bookings and check bus status board. While booking tickets, the user has to enter bus number then the system displays total bus seat numbers with passenger’s name and the user has to enter the number of tickets, seat number, and name of the person. Here, cancel booking also features refunding. Login system is also available in this system to make it more secure. There’s no chance of data misuse or loss & it’s not time-consuming. The whole project is developed in ‘C’ Programming language, different variables and strings have been used for the development of this project. It’s easy to operate and understand by users.
